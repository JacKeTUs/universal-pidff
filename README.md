# Universal Force Feedback driver for Linux

Linux PIDFF driver with useful patches for initialization of FFB devices. Primarily targeting Direct Drive wheelbases.

## What's different between this and native pidff driver?
That driver allows most DirectDrive wheelbases to initialize and work.
Most of the DirectDrive wheelbases are basically DirectInput wheels, but with some caveats, which Windows allows, but pidff doesn't.
In that repository - pidff driver with some changes, which allows most of the DirectDrive wheelbases to work.

1. Added quirks for better initialization rules for different wheelbases (MOZA, VRS, Cammus)
2. Fixes for infinite-length effects
3. Fixes for out-of-bounds values (no more spam in kernel logs)

And that's basically it

## What devices are supported?
### Bases:
1. MOZA R3, R5, R9, R12, R16, R21
2. Cammus C5, C12
3. ...

## What works?
1. FFB (all effects from device descriptor)
2. All inputs (wheel axis, buttons)


## What does not work?
1. Telemetry functions (Shift lights, displays, SimHub, etc), mostly because telemetry works only with proprietary soft, which can't get access to shared memory chunks from games.
2. `Firmware Update` function. Use Windows PC or Windows VM at the moment.
3. Setup through proprietary software. May require [some tweaking](#how-to-set-up-a-base-parameters))

## How to install this driver?
You can install it through AUR package, through DKMS or manually.

On SecureBoot enabled systems you will need additional steps for load this driver into the system. See [Signing](docs/SIGNING.md#signing) section.

### AUR package
There's an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/universal-pidff-dkms-git) for Arch Linux maintained by [@Lawstorant](https://github.com/Lawstorant).

### DKMS
DKMS will install module into system, and will update it every time you update your kernel. Module will persist after reboots. It's the preferrable way to install it on the most distros.

1. Install `dkms` package from your distro package manager
2. Clone repository to `/usr/src/universal-pidff`
3. Install the module:
`sudo dkms install /usr/src/universal-pidff`
4. Update initramfs:
`sudo update-initramfs -u`
5. Reboot

To remove module:
`sudo dkms remove universal-pidff/<version> --all`

### Manually
Best for debugging purposes, where you need frequently change codebase/branches
1. Install `linux-headers-$(uname -r)` and `build-essential` packages from your distro package manager
2. Clone repository anywhere you want and `cd` into that directory
3. `make`. Alternatively, you can enable debug logs from the driver with `make debug`
4. Load module into system with `sudo insmod hid-universal-pidff.ko`

To unload module:
`sudo rmmod hid_universal_pidff`

## Known issues with the driver
- Current limit of usable buttons is 160 (up from the Linux default of 80). Create an issue if you want this increased further.
